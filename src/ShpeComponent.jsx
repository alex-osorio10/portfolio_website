          <h2>My Involvement</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Marketing and Social Media Officer, responsible for promoting SHPE at Portland State University 
            through social media and creating engaging flyers to boost visibility and member participation. I also 
            manage, design, and update Portland Stateâ€™s SHPE websites. Moving forward, I plan to continue my involvement 
            with SHPE throughout my career, using my skills to support and uplift the Hispanic community.
